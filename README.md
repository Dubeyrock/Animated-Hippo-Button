# Interactive Hippo Button With Eyes Tracking Your Mouse


I love this epic button that looks like a hippopotamus and the eye follow your mouse movement and the ears wiggle and when you hover over it, the hippo opens its mouth. This button uses GSAP was designed by Mariusz Dabrowski and works well for a zoo or other animal-related websites.

The word hippopotamus loosely translates as “river horse” from Ancient Greek. It’s certainly an apt name, as these creatures spend most of their lives in water, only leaving at dusk to feed on grasses. They can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes, which means they’re even able to give birth and sleep underwater. In fact, in much the same way that breathing and blinking are automatic for us humans, hippos know when to surface for oxygen subconsciously, so they come up regularly for breaths even while staying fast asleep! Although these mammals spend a considerable amount of time underwater, you may be surprised to learn that they can’t really swim! Instead, they simply walk or run along the riverbed, pushing themselves up through the water for air.
